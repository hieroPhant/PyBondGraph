#--------------------------------------------------------
# A "graph"1 in mathematics and computer science consists 
# of "nodes", also known as "vertices". 
# Nodes may or may not be connected with one another.
# 
# The connecting line between two nodes is called an edge. 
# If the edges between the nodes are undirected, 
# the graph is called an undirected graph. 
# If an edge is directed from one vertex (node) to another,
# a graph is called a directed graph. 
# An directed edge is called an arc. 
# 
# Python has no built-in data type or class for graphs, 
# but it is easy to implement them in Python. 
# One data type is ideal for representing graphs in 
# Python, i.e. dictionaries.
# The graph in our illustration can be implemented in the following way:
# 
# graph = { "a" : ["c"],
#           "b" : ["c", "e"],
#           "c" : ["a", "b", "d", "e"],
#           "d" : ["c"],
#           "e" : ["c", "b"],
#           "f" : []
#         }

#   A tree is an undirected graph which contains no cycles. 
#   This means that any two vertices of the graph are connected

#   A forest is a disjoint union of trees. 
#   Contrary to forests in nature, a forest in graph theory
